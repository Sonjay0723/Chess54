This is the implementation of a chess game

The pieces package contains a superclass to create an object for the definition of each piece, with each of them having a value 
(value consist of two characters, the first one being the color and the second being the type of piece [eg.rook, queen, etc])
The value is different for emptySquare, meaning no piece is on it, either "##" for a black tile or "  " for a white tile
There are multiple subclasses in this package, each subclass representing a different piece. These subclasses override the 
superclass method for weather or not the move is valid.

The Chess package contains 2 classes, one called position and one called chess.
the position class is creating the object to find various positions on the board and which "pieces" are on each "tile". 
It is defined by int row and int column(self-explanatory)
The chess class contains the hashmap that represents the chess board and sets it up with pieces for the start of the game.
It is also the one that does all the work, it checks for enPassant, Castling, promotions, checks, checkmate, makes sure moves 
are valid by calling in the corresponding pieces subclass, moves the pieces, ends the game, and all other elements the game 
is supposed to have.
